Here I learn a new thing that is how to use toggle method in JavaScript.This advantage is we don't need to check condition with if/else and write extra code.This method is simplify to me and easy to implement our logic.Also I learn how to use media query to hide toggle button in large screen and show in small screen or our selected screen.

Happy CodingðŸ™‚
